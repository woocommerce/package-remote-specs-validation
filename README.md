## Working with Schema

If it's your first time working with JSON Schema, we highly recommend reading <https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step> first. 

1. Open a schema file from `schemas` directory.
2. Make changes.
3. Run `./bin/build schemas/:name-of-schema-file`
4. Bundled schema file will be saved in `bundles` directory.

## Validation Examples

```php
use Automattic\WooCommerce\Tests\RemoteSpecsValidation\RemoteSpecValidator;
$validator = RemoteSpecValidator::create_from_bundle( 'remote-inbox-notification' );

$spec = json_decode( file_get_contents(":your-remote-inbox-noficiation-json") );

$result = $validator->validate( $spec );

if ( !$result->is_valid() ) {
	var_dump( $result->get_errors() );
} else {
	var_dump('everyting looks good!');
}
```
